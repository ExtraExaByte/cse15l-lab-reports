## Installing VSCode

### Lets get started by installing VSCode

<br>
VSCode is immensly useful for a number of different reasons.  


<br>
In this lab, we will be using it for its terminal to connect to our ieng6 workstation.  
<br>
<br>
Just to emphasize on how useful VSCode is, I am currently using it to write this website for you and see my updates in real time, but I digress, let get to work!

First step is to navigate to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the version for your operating system.  If you are unsure what you are using (which would be concerning) then a quick google search will provide steps on how to test.
 
In this report I will be focusing on Mac systems.  OS X with Apple Silicon to be specific.
